# Advent of Code 2020

This is my [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) repo.

The code in here is not always pretty. It hasn't been polished or optimized and I often go with the brute force approach instead of finding a more elegant solution. I often stop once I obtain the correct answer. My goal this year was to finish the entire challange, so I wasn't as concerned with code quality, maintainability, readability, etc as I would be in a real world project.
